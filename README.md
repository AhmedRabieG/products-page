Description:
This is a simple Vue 3 application that demonstrates how to manage product cards with dynamic functionality like adding to the cart and toggling favorites. It also includes a loading state to simulate product loading, along with visual feedback for actions like "Item Added to Cart" and "Favorite Toggled." The project showcases common Vue features such as props, ref, v-for, v-if, events, and computed properties.

Additionally, the application uses Tailwind CSS for styling and demonstrates handling asynchronous operations with a simulated loading state and a transition effect.
